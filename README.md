# Fork info

This is a fork of [LinkFT](https://github.com/ykeara/LinkFT), created to:
- start auto-updating the module, and stop auto-downgrading the module to the previous version after updating it manually
- show the proper "last updated" date
- stop crashing my VRCFT
- possibly add some improvements
- (and to just learn something new)
